# termocast

if you want to test this project do this 

put the key api key in the .env file as
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY = your_key

then you can cargo run it 
if you are running it from binary then 
you can just set the env variable before running it
export OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key && termocast
or $env OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key; termocast

or you can do whatever there is in the docs of your shell to set env variables
